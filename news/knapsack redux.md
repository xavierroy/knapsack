Some of you may remember this newsletter from its first incarnation. Others may be new here. Either way, this is a fresh start. A reboot. A chance to rediscover what _Knapsack_ was meant to be.

> We shall not cease from exploration

> 
> Will be to arrive where we started
> 
> And know the place for the first time.

This theme of starting over has been on my mind lately. I recently turned 45. A milestone, though I’m still figuring out what it means. And just before that, I decided to take a break from work. A different kind of milestone, one that forces you to pause, reassess, and decide what comes next.

So, I’m relaunching **Knapsack**, my newsletter—a satchel of stories, wisdom, and wonder. Expect deep dives into books, ideas, technology, and the odd, delightful things that make the world interesting. If you enjoyed my past musings on writing, learning, and curiosity, you’ll find more of that here—this time with a renewed sense of purpose.

The first rebooted issue drops soon. **Update**: You can read [[../issues/07|Issue 07]].

Till next time,
